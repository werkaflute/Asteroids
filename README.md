# Asteroids - simple game which was created in Unity 3D

The project was prepared for student research circle "Vertex". This student research circle deals with computer graphics, especially creating games in Unity.

Asteroids was our first project, we have done it in a group of three. The main goal was to develop the game which was presented at the meeting.

We decided to do a few things:

* to add a new background
* to crumble asteroids ( using ObjectPool which contains asteroids)
* to score points and lives in the game
* to create new models ( spaceship, asteroids)
